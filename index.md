## Daniel Evans-Yamamoto's homepage


### Thank you for visiting my homepage.

I built this so that I can present who I am, and what I do in both life and work.<br>
The message behid this is that I want to become in touch with people I haven't had the chance to meet yet (Or purely make myself known to people who barely know me).Read more about me [here](https://danyamamotoevans.github.io/about).<br>
If you find me (or what I do) interesting, please contact me. I'd be more than happy.
<br><br><br>
Cheers,<br>
Dan<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
My contact is in the CV page :)
