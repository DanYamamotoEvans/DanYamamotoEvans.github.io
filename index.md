## Thank you for visiting my website.

I built this website so that I can present who I am, and what I do in both life and work.
The message behid this is that I want to become in touch with people I haven't had the chance to meet yet (Or purly make myself known to people who barely know me).
If you find me (or what I do) interesting, please contact me. I'd be more than happy.

Cheers,
Dan

P.S. My contact is in the CV page :)
