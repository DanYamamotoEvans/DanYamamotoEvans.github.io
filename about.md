## Biography
Born a hybrid of Japan and New Zealand, he experienced growing up both in the busiest and relaxing places in the world. Tokyo is where he was mostly raised, except for a year in 2008, where he lived with his grandparents (Lloyd and Krista) in Feilding, New Zealand.
He is currently a PhD candidate at Keio University, Japan. Up until his master’s study, he worked with [Dr. Nozomu Yachie](http://yachie-lab.org/index.php?nozomuyachie) at The University of Tokyo, acquiring knowledge on synthetic biology and synthetic DNA barcodes to screen Protein-protein interactions. Later, while still affiliated with Keio University, he moved to [Dr. Christian Landry](https://landrylab.ibis.ulaval.ca/project/christian-landry-phd)’s laboratory at Université Laval (Quebec City, Canada), supported by the JSPS DC1 fellowship (until 2023/9/30). There he worked on characterizing evolution of protein function through protein-protein interactions.
