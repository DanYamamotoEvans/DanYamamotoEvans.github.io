## About me

Born a hybrid of Japan and New Zealand, I could experience growing up both the busiest and relaxing places in the world. Tokyo is where I was mostly raised, playing competitive baseball for 10 years until high school. In the year 2008, I spent 8 months in Feilding New Zealand,staying with my grandparents. That is where I discoverd the fasninating sport rugby (Go All Blacks!!). <br>
  Since 2014, I have been studying in the feild of molecular biology on protien-protein interactions and high-throughput methods surrounding them. I have and still am working in this area under supervision of Dr. [Nozomu Yachie](http://yachie-lab.org/index.php?nozomuyachie). Please read about our projects and scientific aims [here](http://yachie-lab.org/index.php?research). I am pursuing to Ph.D. course next year in Yachie lab. After obtaining my degree, I am planning for post doctoral research abroad (2023? Long way to go!).
