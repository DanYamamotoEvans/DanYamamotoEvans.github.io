## About me

Born a hybrid of Japan and New Zealand, I could experience growing up both the busiest and relaxing places in the world. Tokyo is where I was mostly raised, playing competitive baseball for 10 years until high school. In the year 2008, I spent 8 months in Feilding New Zealand,staying with my grandparents. That is where I discoverd the fasninating sport rugby (Go All Blacks!!). Life is going good since then.
